A link shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and generates a shorter, more concise link that redirects to the original URL. This can be useful in situations where you need to share a URL, but the original link is too long or difficult to remember.

Here's a high-level overview of how to build a link shortener:

Create a database to store the long URLs and their corresponding short URLs.

When a user submits a URL to be shortened, generate a random string (e.g., "abc123") to serve as the short URL.

Store the original URL and the short URL in the database.

When someone clicks on the short URL, redirect them to the original URL.

Here are some more detailed steps what shouls we take care:


this  application i create ung react mongo and Node,


Create a database
Choose a database management system (such as MySQL or MongoDB)
Create a table to store the original URLs and their corresponding short URLs
Define the columns for the table, such as "long_url", "short_url", and "created_at"
Set up a connection to the database using a driver or ORM (such as SQLAlchemy)
Generate a short URL
When a user submits a URL, generate a random string to use as the short URL
Make sure the generated string is unique and not already in use
Store the original URL and the short URL in the database
Return the short URL to the user
Store the URLs in the database
When a user submits a URL, store it in the database along with the generated short URL and the current timestamp
Make sure to validate the input URL to ensure it's valid and safe to store
Redirect to the original URL
When someone clicks on a short URL, look up the corresponding original URL in the database
